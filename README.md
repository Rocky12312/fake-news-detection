# fake-news-detection

The goal of the Fake News Challenge is to explore how artificial intelligence technologies, particularly machine learning and 
natural language processing, might be leveraged to combat the fake news problem. We believe that these AI technologies hold 
promise for significantly automating parts of the procedure human fact checkers use today to determine if a story is real or fake.

Here basically we took use of four datasets from kaggle to train amodel to detect whether a news is Fake or Legitimate.
